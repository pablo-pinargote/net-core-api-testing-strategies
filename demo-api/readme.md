# tests-tryout-2 branch.

## Should and Dependency Injection

The second tryout introduces some major changes and concepts:

- Every test class's suffix should be word "Should".
- Each test class becomes a test case on its own, and each method represents a test case result.
- We have introduced dependency injection, interfaces, and mock injections.
