# Testing strategy for C#.

This repository is intended for exploring different coding alternatives for tests. It is organized through the git branches, with each branch aiming to demonstrate various approaches and efficient methods for testing the code hosted in the demo-api project.

- The branches are not intended to be merged at any time; they are simply a mechanism for learning about this strategy progressively.
- The main branch do not have any tests, and that is intentional.

Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance!
